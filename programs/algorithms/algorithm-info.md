## Practice in implementing
* [Codewars - write code to solve the task from the instructions(they get increasingly harder with higher ranks) and after that compare it with solutions of other's](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard)
* [LeetCode - practice algorithms, data structures and code interview questions](https://leetcode.com)



# Timing algorithms execution time
* On linux - `time <executable(e.g. "./program.o" or "python program.py")>`(e.g. time python program.py)
